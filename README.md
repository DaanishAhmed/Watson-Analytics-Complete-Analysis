Complete Data Analysis on Vehicle Accident Data
----------------

This project involves the use of Watson Analytics to analyze a dataset containing vehicle accident information.  In my analysis, I explored the data using an exploratory data analysis (EDA), leveraged visualizations, built decision trees to classify accident severity, communicated my findings using dashboards and storybooks, and implemented social media data to enhance my findings.

The full report can be found in the file "Complete Analysis.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data refinement, decision tree development, display development, model results, social media implementation, and proposed solutions.  Tables and visualizations are included in the appendix.

The original dataset is located in the file "Accidents_2015.csv".  It was obtained from data.gov.uk.  I have included a cleaned version of this file for which I handled outliers, missing values, and errors.  The cleaned version also uses the code sheet "stats19.pdf" provided by data.gov.uk.  This cleaned file was the dataset that I used in Watson Analytics.

The social media data can only be obtained directly from Watson Analytics.  It was created by importing Twitter data and using hashtags related to accident severity and weather conditions (including hashtags such as accident, police, flood,
fog, ice, rain, snow, and wind).
